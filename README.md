# jekyll-search-server

A standalone search crawler and API for Jekyll sites.

## Prerequisites

1. A Jekyll site (running locally, remotely, or both)
2. The Jekyll sites use the [jekyll_pages_api](https://github.com/18F/jekyll_pages_api) plugin.
3. A running Elasticsearch instance ([quickstart]())

## Usage

Clone the repo, `cd` into it and install dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com/18f/jekyll-search-server
cd jekyll-search-server
bundle install
```

Add the URLs for your Jekyll sites via environment variables:

- `JEKYLL_SEARCH_DEV_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:4000`)
- `JEKYLL_SEARCH_PROD_URL` (there is no default, set this if you need it)

Crawl and index with a single `rake` task:

```
bundle exec rake pages:crawl
```

Run the server and test out the API:

```
bundle exec rails s
```

In another terminal tab:

```
curl http://localhost:3000/search\?q\=%22How%20to%20write%20a%20blog%22
{
   "query":"\"How to write a blog\"",
   "results":[
      {
         "id":1262,
         "title":"How to write a blog for 18F",
         "path":"/blogging/",
         "body":"How to write a blog for 18F At 18F we keep a private GitHub repo for kicking around ideas on the blog. This is how we use that repo. We use milestones for workflow tracking: idea draft ready approved For new posts: Drop ideas for future blog posts into the ideas milestone as individual issues. Please include the following headings: ## Audience ## Goal of blog post ## Imagery ideas ## Description â€“ This is what people will see in the blog post list. If you'd like to create a separate description, insert it here; otherwise, we'll likely use the first couple of sentences of the post. ## Who needs to clear the post as a checklist (on your end, not GSA's), then come back and check them off when approved. Examples: [ ] partner at agency [ ] stakeholder Any team member can \"pick up\" issues and begin drafting a post. Once an issue is in writing mode, move it to the drafts milestone. Create a Google Doc in the Blog folder with the text of your post. Include the URL of the GitHub issue at the top. Paste a link to the doc in the issue. Once post is ready for comms approval: Assign the issue to @quepol (Hillary). Move it to the ready milestone. Share the doc with: Ori Hoffer Gianelle Rivera (congressional) Jackeline Stewart Johnson (press secretary) After comments/suggestions are received from them, move the issue to the approved milestone. Write a new comment and /cc @gboone @OriHoffer, who will: Help you follow the blogging guide to convert the post to Markdown, if you like Post it to staging Post it to production Once post goes live, close the issue.",

```

### Elasticsearch quickstart

OSX:

Install `brew` if you don't already have it:

```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Then install Elasticsearch and start the Elasticsearch server:

```
brew install elasticsearch
elasticsearch --config=/usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml
```

Ubuntu:

### Elasticsearch Configuration

`searchkick` is used to handle all Elasticsearch tasks. By default, it looks at `ENV["ELASTICSEARCH_URL"]` (which defaults to`localhost:9200`) for the Elasticsearch server. However you can change that by creating a Rails initializer in `config/initializers/elasticsearch.rb`:

```ruby
ENV["ELASTICSEARCH_URL"] = "http://username:password@api.searchbox.io"
```

# TODO

- make this easily installable on Cloud Foundry
- remove sqlite, replace with postgres (a requirement for Cloud Foundry)
- set up GitHub webhook listener
